const requireAdmin = (user) => {
  const authenticatedUser = requireAuth(user);
  if (authenticatedUser.role !== 'ADMIN') {
    throw new Error('You must be an admin to perform this action');
  }
  return authenticatedUser;
};
```

### **2. Advanced Database Design**

### **3. Intelligent Product Filtering System**
```graphql
# Showcasing advanced GraphQL query capabilities
query GetProducts($filter: ProductFilterInput) {
  products(filter: $filter) {
    id
    name
    price
    inventory
    category { name }
  }
}
```

### **4. Enterprise-Grade Order Management**
- **Inventory Tracking** with automatic stock updates
- **Transaction Management** ensuring data consistency
- **Order Status Workflow** with proper state management
- **Financial Calculations** with precise decimal handling

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v16+
- PostgreSQL v13+
- npm/yarn

### Installation
```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone <repository-url>
cd ecommerce-graphql-api
npm install

# Database setup
createdb ecommerce_db

# Configure environment (update config.env)
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Optional: Populate with sample data
npm run seed
```

### Test the API
Visit `http://localhost:4000/graphql` and try these credentials:
- **Admin**: admin@ecommerce.com / admin123
- **Customer**: customer@example.com / customer123

## 📊 Database Architecture

I've designed a normalized database schema that efficiently handles complex e-commerce relationships:

```sql
-- Core entities with proper relationships
Users (1) ←→ (∞) Orders ←→ (∞) OrderItems ←→ (1) Products ←→ (1) Categories
```

### **Key Design Decisions**
- **UUID Primary Keys**: Enhanced security and distributed system compatibility
- **Enum Fields**: Data consistency for status and role fields  
- **Indexed Columns**: Optimized queries for search and filtering
- **Cascading Relationships**: Proper data cleanup and referential integrity

## 🔐 Security Implementation

### **Authentication & Authorization**
```javascript
// Multi-layered security approach
const context = async ({ req }) => {
  const user = await getUser(req); // JWT validation
  return { user };
};

// Role-based access control
const requireAdmin = (user) => {
  // Implementation ensures only authorized access
};
```

### **Data Protection**
- **Password Hashing**: bcryptjs with salt rounds
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Sequelize ORM parameterized queries
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation for all user inputs
- **Error Sanitization**: Secure error messages that don't expose system details

## 📖 API Documentation & Examples

### **User Authentication Flow**
```graphql
# Registration
mutation {
  register(input: {
    email: "developer@company.com"
    password: "securePassword123"
    firstName: "John"
    lastName: "Developer"
  }) {
    token
    user { id email role }
  }
}
```

### **Advanced Product Filtering**
```graphql
# Intelligent search and filtering
query {
  products(filter: {
    searchTerm: "laptop"
    categoryId: "electronics-uuid"
    minPrice: 500
    maxPrice: 2000
  }) {
    id name price inventory
    category { name }
  }
}
```

### **Order Management**
```graphql
# Complete order creation with inventory management
mutation {
  createOrder(input: {
    items: [
      { productId: "product-uuid", quantity: 2 }
    ]
  }) {
    id totalAmount status
    items { quantity unitPrice subtotal }
  }
}
```
